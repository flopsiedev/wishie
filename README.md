What is this?
---
If you don't trust that it's a simple wishlist app, it's intended to be a single paste away from building a wishlist from anywhere on the internet! Once you have all you need, it should be a simple share the link with anyone you'd like!

My parents were asking me to make a wishlist for the rest of the family. I was really only using Amazon's wishlist, and in turn, Amazon's inventory. To put my feelings of Amazon aside, I wanted a way to just **share a list of items, no matter where they were, in a simple way that wasn't a hassle to put together**.
